# Hi, Wish you a wonderful day

## About me

My name is Nguyen Thanh Duy, a Software Engineer who loves building software that helps people.

I started self-learning in 2022 and have explored various languages and technologies such as Flutter, Bash, Python, C++, Rust, and more. I’m committed to continuously creating meaningful software and contributing to the Open Source community.

Soon, I’ll start writing a blog about my self-learning journey, sharing the tips and experiences I’ve gained along the way. If you’re interested, feel free to check it out on my portfolio site.

Please take a look at my projects, and if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out — I’m always open to connecting.
