# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! â€” Wish you a wonderful day!

## About me

My name is **Nguyen Thanh Duy (Ken)** â€” a **Software Engineer** who loves building software that helps people move toward better things.

I began self-learning in **2022** and have worked with a variety of languages and technologies: `Flutter`, `Bash`, `Python`, `C++`, `Rust`,...
I will continue to create useful applications and contribute to the **Open Source** community.

Soon I'll publish a blog about my self-learning journey where I'll share tips, notes, and lessons learned. If you're curious, you can check it out on my portfolio.

If you have any questions or want to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out â€” I'm always open to connecting.
